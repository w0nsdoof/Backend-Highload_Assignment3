# Project Overview

This project demonstrates a scalable, robust backend system using Django, Gunicorn, Nginx, PostgreSQL, and monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. The aim is to address the challenges associated with high-load distributed environments, ensuring data consistency, system scalability, and effective observability.

## Features Implemented

- **Django API**: Developed a simple API using Djangoâ€™s generics views and model serializers to streamline backend functionalities.
- **Multiple Gunicorn Instances**: Configured three separate Gunicorn services to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Nginx Load Balancing**: Used Nginx as a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across Gunicorn instances for better system reliability and responsiveness.
- **Database Scaling**: Set up a primary PostgreSQL database with a read replica to offload read-heavy operations, enhancing overall query response times.
